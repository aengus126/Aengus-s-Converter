# Aengus's Converter
A simple, downloadable (offline) file converter made in Python, using Pillow and Pillow-HEIF
Hi, I made something similar a few years ago, but I finally decided to make it a full
application by giving it a UI with TKinter and building it with PyInstaller. It's primative
and doesn't do much more than what Pillow allows, but I had a hard time finding something similar
online that does a good job. 

Advantages of my converter:
  Can handle HEIC (apple image) files
  Just 25 MBs, fairly simple to use
  Very wide range of formats to import/export from

Disadvantages of my converter:
  Somebody probably already did this but better
  Is made in Python, so its not optimized the best
